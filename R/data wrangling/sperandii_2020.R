Methods: 'The selected 188 plots were originally sampled between 2002 and 2007 (hereafter T0) throughout the first portion of the coastal zonation, therefore including annual pioneer communities of the upper beach, embryonic dunes, mobile dunes and coastal stable dune grasslands. Specifically, 63 plots were sampled in 2002, 56 were sampled in 2005 and 59 in 2007.[...]Historical plots were revisited and resampled in 2017 (hereafter T1), following the same methods used by the original surveyors. This allowed us to evaluate changes occurred over 10â€“15 years. During the resurvey, special care was taken to perform the resampling during the same months in which the original sampling was done (April-May).'This dataset is part of database http://www.givd.info/ID/EU-IT-020",
