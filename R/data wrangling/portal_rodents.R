METHODS: 'The data set includes continuing monthly rodent surveys. Each month rodents are trapped on all 24 experimental plots and information on each captured rodent is [Not] contained in this file.[Individual information is available in the original data but not included here.]Rodent access to plots is regulated using gates cut into the fencing. Large gates (3.7 x 5.7 cm) allow all small mammals to access plots. Small gates (1.9 x 1.9 cm) exclude kangaroo rats (*Dipodomys*) whose inflated auditory bullae make their skulls too large to pass through the gates. Rodent removal plots do not contain any gates and animals caught on those plots are removed and released outside the cattle exclosure fence.
From 1977-present, plots were trapped around each new moon, which occurs approximately once a month. The survey occurs as close to the new moon as possible to minimize external effects on trapping success which could be misconstrued as actual changes in populations. [...]During a survey (2 nights), each plot is trapped for one night, with treatments divided evenly between the 2 nights to eliminate differences between controls and treatments caused by environmental differences on different nights. When a plot is surveyed, all gates are closed to ensure that only resident individuals are captured. At each stake, one Sherman live-trap is placed and baited with millet seed. Traps are collected the next morning and individuals processed.'
