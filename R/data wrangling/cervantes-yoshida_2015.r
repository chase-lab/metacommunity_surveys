Here we were able to reconstruct an approximately identical study design and effort based on these field notes and from input from RAL. Each site was sampled in same location, and there was no difference in site reach length between the two time periods (paired t-test, P = 0.534).' Coordinates of the mouth of the Alameda Creek",
