A total of 24 photographic quadrats of 25 * 25 cm (replicates) were analysed for each site and temporal point resulting in 360 pictures in total. The sampling unit (625 cm2 per replicate) was selected following Kipson et al. (2011) and Casas-Guell et al. (2015). The percent cover of the different macro benthic sessile species was calculated in each quadrat by overimposing 100 stratified random points and identifying the underlying species to the lowest possible taxonomic level, using Photoquad photoquadrat' ",
