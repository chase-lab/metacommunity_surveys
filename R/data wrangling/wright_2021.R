Methods: 'We focused on three major ecosystem types: Chihuahuan Desert shrubland, which is dominated by creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), Chihuahuan Desert grassland, which is dominated by black grama grass (Bouteloua eriopoda (Torr.) Torr.), and Plains grassland, which is dominated by blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis (Willd. Ex Kunth) Lag. Ex Griffiths). In our study, the two Chihuahuan Desert sites were separated by ~2 km; the Plains grassland site was ~10 km from the Chihuahuan Desert sites.[...] Bees were sampled along five transects located within each of the three focal ecosystem types. To sample bees, we installed one passive funnel trap at each end of five 200 m transects/site. Each trap consisted of a 946 mL paint can filled with ~275 mL of propylene glycol and topped with a plastic automotive funnel with the narrow part of the funnel sawed off (funnel height = 10 cm, top diameter = 14 cm, bottom diameter = 2.5 cm. The funnelsâ€™ interiors were painted with either blue or yellow fluorescent paint (Krylon, Cleveland, OH or Ace Hardware, Oak Brook, IL). On each transect, we randomly assigned one trap to be blue and the other to be yellow (total across the three sites: N = 30 traps, with 15 traps/color). Each trap was placed on a 45 cm high platform that was surrounded by a 60 cm high chicken wire cage to prevent wildlife and wind disturbance. Funnel traps provide a measure of bee activity, not a measure of presence, and may be biased by bee taxon and sociality. From 2002 to 2014, bees were sampled each month from March through October' IMPORTANT the authors warn that the abundance values they report should be considered as proxies of bee activity, not relative importance.",
