METHODS constant: 'Breeding birds were monitored in spring during a longitudinal long-term scientific study that recorded point counts of any species heard or seen (Blondel et al., 1981). Two sessions were run (20 min in April and 20 min between mid-May and mid-June), and the highest abundance for each species between the two sessions was retained. Point counts were regularly spaced along the riverbank (1â€“5 km depending on the river) to limit the risk of double counting birds moving across a large area, and were strictly identical for each session [...] Variability associated with observers was limited, as only 12, experienced ornithologists conducted all censuses, and a given point count was monitored by the same observer, who adopted the same protocol each year.'",
