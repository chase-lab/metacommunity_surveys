## wrangled data folder
This folder is used to locally save dthe data after it was downloaded and wrangled.
All files are csv files with the same structure. The script R/3.0_merging_long-format_tables.r
reads them all, binds them together and checks the data integrity.
These files are not syncrhronised on git and github because they can easily be obtained
from raw data using the provided scripts.
