variable name	definition
dataset_id	"Unique ID linked to a publication (article or data set). If the data set was split because different taxa group are provided, a letter is added at the end. No missing value."
year	"Year of sampling. If sampling was pooled over several years, the last sampling year is used here. No missing value."
regional	"Region name, contains at least two localities. Can be a national park, a state or a forest name for example but smaller scales are also included where the region is an experimental sites. A data set can have several regions. No missing value."
local	"Name or code of the sampled locality or experimental sample as given by the original data provider. For example, it can correspond to the name of an island, a lake or forest. No missing value."
latitude	"Latitude North in decimal degree, WGS84. Site specific coordinates were included when available."
longitude	"Longitude East in decimal degree, WGS84. Site specific coordinates were included when available."
effort	"Sampling effort expressed for example as the number of visits to a plot or the total area sampled in a given year. See Comment column for a description. No missing value."
study_type	"one of ""resurvey"" or ""ecological sampling"". RESURVEY: typically two samplings separated by a long, 20+ years, stretch of time and a great deal of effort is put in matching very precisely historical plots or transects. ECOLOGICAL SAMPLING: these studies generally involve more samplings than resurveys: 10 samplings, 1 every few years. No missing value."
data_pooled_by_authors	TRUE if the data provided by the authors was already pooled covering several years: several samples made over several years pooled together. No missing value.
data_pooled_by_authors_comment	"If there was pooling by the original authors, countains free text describing how the authors pooled their data. NA value indicates that there was no pooling by the original authors."
sampling_years	"If there was pooling by the original authors, contains the years sampled for each period. ""1997, 1999"" means 1997 and 1999, ""1997-1999"" means 1997 to 1999 with no gap. NA value indicates that there was no pooling by the original authors."
alpha_grain_m2	"Area of the local unit or area of the sampling gear (in which case alpha_grain_type = sample). NA values indicate that information could not be collected."
alpha_grain_type	"Category of alpha_grain specifying what does the alpha_grain measure relate to. Allowed values are: ""island"", ""plot"", ""sample"", ""lake_pond"", ""trap"", ""transect"", ""ecosystem"" (eg the area of the whole wetland or generally the area of adjacent comparable habitat), ""box"" (a box covering the sites) or ""quadrat"". No missing value."
alpha_grain_comment	"Description of the alpha_grain measure. NA values indicate that information could not be collected."
gamma_bounding_box_km2	"Measure of the extent/regional scale area as the area covering all sites, computed as a convex-hull or a rectangle box or as the area of the administrative unit in which sites are found. NA values indicate that information could not be collected."
gamma_bounding_box_type	"Category of gamma_bounding_box, one of: ""administrative"" (eg the area of a park or state), ""island"", ""convex-hull"", ""watershed"", ""box"" (a box covering the sites), ""buffer"", ""ecosystem"" (eg the area of the whole wetland or generally the area of adjacent comparable habitat), ""shore"" or ""lake_pond"". NA values indicate that information ensues from alpha_grain_type or that it could not be collected."
gamma_bounding_box_comment	"Description or source of the gamma_bounding_box value."
gamma_sum_grains_km2	"Measure of the extent/regional scale area as the sum of the grains sampled each year. NA values indicate that information could not be collected."
gamma_sum_grains_type	"Category of gamma_sum_grains, one of: ""archipelago"", ""administrative"" (eg the area of a park or state), ""watershed"", ""sample"", ""lake_pond"", ""plot"", ""quadrat"", ""transect"", ""ecosystem"" (eg the area of the whole wetland or generally the area of adjacent comparable habitat) or ""box"" (a box covering the sites). NA values indicate that information ensues from alpha_grain_type or that it could not be collected."
gamma_sum_grains_comment	"Description or source of the gamma_sum_grains value."
realm	"Realm in which the sampling was done, one of: Freshwater or Terrestrial. No missing value."
taxon	"Taxon group of the data set, one of: ""Plants"", ""Invertebrates"" or ""Fish"". No missing value."
comment	"A description of the data set origin, goal and sampling method. No missing value."
comment_standardisation	"A short description of the modifications we made to the data set to ensure standard effort: excluded sites or years, excluded taxa, etc."
is_coordinate_local_scale	Logical. TRUE if coordinates are given at the scale of the site/locality. FALSE if the coordinates are at the regional scale or missing. No missing value.
